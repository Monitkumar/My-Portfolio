# [Project 1 : Disastrous Tweets Classification](https://github.com/Monitkumar/Tweets_classification_app)
The Twitter platform provides an enormous amount of data. A machine learning algorithm needs a lot of data to build a good model.So, itâ€™s a good idea we construct an ML predictor by training with Twitter data.
We will build a classifier whether a user has a specific political view or not. We use Twitter tweets, users, and friend data to construct the classifier. Also, we will use a random forest as our learning algorithm and Python as our development platform.

# Steps:
1. Identify and collect Twitter data.
2. Label the data.
3. Do feature engineering.
4. Transform the data.
5. Train the model.
6. Evaluate the model.
